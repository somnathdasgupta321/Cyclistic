    "text": "Hello everyone, it’s been a few months since I’ve been working on the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate through Coursera. Throughout this journey I’ve accumulated lots of interesting, insightful and most importantly, useful information about various tools that were included with the bundle, such as Tableau, R programming, SQL, Spreadsheets.\n\n\nThis particular curriculum also introduced me to various sorts of standardized practices and also gave me a universal framework to follow throughout every single project along with some key data analyst terminologies and processes. Now below is a brief walk through of my thought process and overall understanding that I have gained overtime by completing this case study that is included with the course by using various tools, methods and strategy."

    "text": "2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nYou are working for Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company. Bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n\n\nCyclistic has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\n\nThe director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships, as finance analysts have concluded that annual memberships are much more profitable than casual riders. She also believes that there is a good chance of converting casual riders to members as they are already aware of a Cyclistic program and have chosen it for their mobility needs."

    "text": "10 CONCLUSION\n\n\nCyclistic have a greater number of subscribed members as compared to casual riders and, based on the overall analysis, the ratio in which casual riders differ from subscribed members is only 13.76%.\nCasual riders mostly prefer the weekend slot for choosing a ride with Cyclistic, which is Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\nSubscribed members in general prefer weekday slots for choosing a ride with Cyclistic,which is Monday to Thursday, as well as the weekend slot.\nBased on twelve month’s data, it was observed that casual riders took the ride for the longest duration of time as compared to subscribed members and also the month which recorded the highest spent time was July.\nDistribution of rideable type seems completely unbalanced and inappropriate as docked bikes seem to have the least significance in terms of the usage distribution where only one bike was rented within an entire year by a subscribed member as compared to casual riders.\nThe overall month’s wise distribution shows that Saturdays and Sundays seem to attract more crowds as compared to all other weekdays and its constant for every single month.\nPeak hours are mostly from 5’oclock to 7’oclock in the evening for both departure and arrival by each of the member types.\nOut of three rideable options, the classic bike is the most endorsed one, followed by the electric bike and the docked bike, which have very minimal interaction with subscribed members especially."

    "text": "11 DELIVERABLE\n\n\nFrom the detailed analysis, it was learned that we need to cater to different sets of casual riders, first, who pursue cyclistic services in a completely oriented manner, and second, who just use them in an emergency or may be once in a while type.\nOne more thing needs to be noted to convert the maximum number of casual riders personified ads and campaigns are very essential and necessary.\nThe other thing is, it’s more about how to cater your services in a way which can have multiple unique value propositions based on the type of customers it is directed or promoted to.\nIt’s better to push some integral benefits that most people are surrounded by today, such as health, and then diversify health into various subsets like protection from cancer, arthritis,stroke etc to specific groups of casual riders.\nFirstly introduce one month trial plan with all yearly perks and benefits and then start charging based on a monthly basis or annual basis.Also, use the old trick in the book by adding their payment information in advance and enabling auto payment on both a monthly, quarterly and yearly basis.\nRemove the one-day subscription plan and include a minimum monthly plan with all the benefits that a member gets yearly and price it higher as compared to the annual plan and discounting should be done in a descending manner.\nTo enable the auto debit feature, ensure users the data is absolutely safe with the cyclistic plus add a tagline saying “We are never hard on commitments”.\nOverall distribution of bikes is completely inappropriate as docked bike is just not considered by any members and it is mostly used by casual members due to unavailability. It is essential that company should consider converting all rideable types to electric bikes with different specifications and variants as the future is electric.\nTo make the subscription plan even more fascinating, some additional gear of its own brand can also be introduced or an association with a renowned brand can also be perfect.\nTry hosting or sponsoring any big events that promote cyclistic and its services under all phenomena and also introduce flesh sales on any special events or occasions as it may help attract more number of customers."
